=====
A really simple python implementation of The OpenPGP HTTP Keyserver Protocol.

Requirements
------------

* PyGPGME (https://launchpad.net/pygpgme)
* Flask   (http://flask.pocoo.org/)

Status
------

Just a quick proof-of-concept, really. I might be using these libraries in some 
upcoming projects.

Using GPG for key storage and search probably has some performance implications 
for a sufficiently busy server.

In addition, serving up public keys out of your personal GnuPG keyring (~/.gnupg) 
might not be something you want to do. Consider changing the Context location.
